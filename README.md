<h1>Hello ğŸ‘‹ My name is Samuel.</h1>
- The ```GM``` in ```GM-Samuelstein``` stands for ```Grandmaster```, as in ```Chess Grandmaster```.
- 
- Chess is my hobby and although i have not achieved a Grandmaster title yet in chess, i will get it for sure some day. 
- 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all i can about software development/engineering, as well as latest technologies in the tech industry.
- 
- ğŸŒ± I started out, for the first time on this road, at the wonderful ALX SE School, May 2022, and it has been an amazing journey so far.
