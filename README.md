<h1 align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Samuel.</h1>

- The 'GM' in GM-Samuelstein stands for Grandmaster, as in Chess Grandmaster.
- Chess is my hobby and although I have not achieved a Grandmaster title yet in chess, I will get it for sure some day, right after I become a Grandmaster in software development and programming.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all I can about software development/programming, as well as the latest technologies in the tech industry.
- ðŸŒ± I started out, for the first time on this road, at the wonderful ALX SE School, May 2022, and it has been an amazing journey so far.
